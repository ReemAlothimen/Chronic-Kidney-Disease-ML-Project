It is commonly assumed that age and blood pressure are the two main indicators when it comes to people who have chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Given the diverse causes of kidney failure, drawing conclusions about the condition based solely on a limited set of factors such as age and blood pressure may not be feasible. 
Is age and blood pressure directly linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD), or are there additional factors that must be considered when diagnosing an individual? 
This project addresses the hypothesis by testing the algorithms on two attributes and comparing the performance when the algorithms are tested on five attributes.
